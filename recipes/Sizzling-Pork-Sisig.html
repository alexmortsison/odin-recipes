    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Sizzling Crispy Sisig is a great dish to prepare during Christmas dinner or in any special occasion. 
        It has a nice texture and the flavor is out-of-this-world. I enjoy having it for dinner with a cup of white rice. 
        It can also be served as an appetizer along with a cold bottle or glass of your favorite drink.</strong>
